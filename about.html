    <p class="about-section-header">About Me</p>
    <p class="about-text">I first picked up programming when I was 12 and decided to learn how to make a Windows GUI
        application. In hindsight perhaps the 150 lines or so of WIN32 API code needed to get a simple window up and
        running wasn't the best way to learn to program, but I was hooked and I haven't looked back since. </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        I got my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from <a class="about-link"
                                                                href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern
        University</a> and spent nearly a decade as a developer working on everything from backend Java and Matlab code
        for an automated keyword bidding to applications for genomic analysis software. I then moved into engineering
        leadership where I have built engineering teams and have been a
        hands on contributor and mentor. During this time I have mostly focused on web applications with Spring Boot +
        Java 8 and Play Framework + Scala and React JS for a single page frontend.

    <p class="about-section-header">Development Process</p>
    <p class="about-text">
        I believe in a development process that encourages quality and a culture of clean code, accountability and
        ownership. An attitude of "This isn't my job" or "I can throw this over the fence"
        are attitudes that should never happen on a high-performing engineering team. Engineers should hold each
        other  accountable through code reviews that encourage checking new features for good practices, sufficient unit and
        integration test coverage and clean code. Much like the dev ops movement has encouraged the close collaboration
        between operations and development I believe all areas of engineering need to follow a paradigm of close collaboration. No one
        should be afraid to jump into other modules of a project.

    <p class="about-section-header">Technical Interests</p>
    <p class="about-text">
        My primary technical skills and interests lie in functional / object-oriented programming in Scala, Java and
        Python and frontend development in React. I'm also interested in machine learning, particularly neural networks.
        I also have an interest in iOS development having developed several
        applications shipped to the app store and am more fond of Swift than I am Objective-C. I'm fairly active on <a
            href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2917326/matt-fowler" class="about-link">Stack Overflow</a> and somewhat
        active on <a href="https://medium.com/coding-with-clarity" class="about-link">Medium</a>. I'm actively
        interested in getting more involved in the engineering community so if you need technical speakers or volunteers
        for your events please <a href="mailto:matt.fow@gmail.com" class="about-link">feel free to get in touch</a>.
